Displaying expertise in HTML, JavaScript, Pug, Express, and CSS, 
I have created five impressive projects. These projects showcase dynamic web applications, 
utilizing a phrase engine for content manipulation. 
The CSS files are meticulously styled with customized colors and background colors, enhancing the visual appeal. 
Additionally, the font family has been changed to a classic style, providing a timeless aesthetic that complements the modern functionality of the applications.
